        <p class="blog-list">
            I'm not going to lie: I think I have a pretty good travel blog. (You probably do too if you're here.) I work hard to provide excellent practical travel advice to help you travel better, but I'm not the only great travel blogger out there. In fact — and I know this might be shocking — there's a lot about travel that I'm not an expert on. Family travel? No idea. Travel as a woman? Clueless. Information on hotels? Only a little. Photography? I can manage to turn my camera on if that counts. Food expert? Only at eating it.
            <br><br>
            I’ve realized that it’s been a while since I last talked about the best travel blogs out there — the ones I read — so I wanted to take a moment and highlight some of my favorite travel blogs that can also help you travel better, cheaper, and smarter. There are so many good blogs out there, I feel like I’m long overdue to point you to some of them:
            <br><br><br>

            <h2 class="blog-list">LEGAL NOMADS</h2><br>

            Besides being one of my all-time favorite people in the world, Jodi is also a damn amazing blogger who writes often about food and culture. She devotes a lot of time to food on the road, taking mouthwatering photos that make me jealous of her ability to do so. A former lawyer, she also writes a series called “Thrillable Hours” about other lawyers who gave up being a corporate lackey for life on the road.<br>

            <h2 class="blog-list">UNCONCERNED MARKET</h2><br>
            <img class="blog-list" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/bestblogs5.jpg"
            alt="Unconcerned Market"

            <p class="blog-list">
                If there was a contest for the best travel blog, I would tell everyone to vote for me. Then I would go vote for Audrey and Dan. They tell heartwarming stories and take incredible, out-of-this-world photographs. Their blog focuses on cultural travel and sustainability issues (they even work with the UN Global Sustainable Tourism Council). I focus on the nuts and bolts of going places, whereas they focus on the people. They are simply great storytellers.
